## Best Practices

### Writing Good Queries

1. **Be specific**: "Unemployment rate" not "economic data"
2. **Include timeframes**: "Last 12 months" not "recent"
3. **Ask for comparisons**: "Compare X and Y"
4. **Request context**: "What does this mean for investors?"

### Using Results

1. **Check percentiles**: Understand if values are high/low
2. **Look at trends**: MoM and YoY show direction
3. **Consider context**: Economic indicators work together
4. **Verify important data**: Double-check critical numbers
